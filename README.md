# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game implemented with Python's Tkinter library! This classic game allows two players to compete against each other in a game of Tic Tac Toe. 

## Features

- **Two Player Mode:** Play against a friend on the same computer.
- **Winning Conditions:** Check for rows, columns, and diagonals to declare a winner.
- **Tie Detection:** Recognize when the game ends in a tie.
- **Automatic Reset:** The game board resets automatically after a win or a tie.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your computer. Tkinter is included with standard Python installations, so no additional packages are required.
